# Summary

This directory contains proposals for web extension APIs, including newly-
introduced APIs and modifications of existing APIs.

# Adding a new proposal

The process for adding a new proposal is outlined in the
[proposal process](proposal_process.md), in which you will create a new proposal
from the [proposal template](proposal_template.md).

# Existing proposals

Proposals here are not "living documents"; that is, they may not be updated
after an API or API change is implemented. They are not meant to replace a more
detailed specification, and may be out-of-date.

They are used for discussing upcoming APIs, and committed once there is broad
consensus on an API.

# Non-normative proposals

A number of proposals were added here before we established the proposal
process. These do not follow the format outlined in the template. All future
proposals should follow the documented [process](proposal_process.md) and use
the [template](proposal_template.md).
